# 🚀 Update: Section 6.2 Uncertainty Estimation (Started)

**Date:** 2025-12-19
**Status:** ✅ start

## 1. Summary of Work
I have successfully completed the tasks for **Section 6.2 (Uncertainty Estimation)**. To satisfy the project requirement of "picking two VPR methods," I performed a comparative analysis between **CosPlace** and **NetVLAD**.

**Key Achievements:**
1.  **NetVLAD Implementation:** Successfully ran NetVLAD (VGG16) on the Tokyo-XS test set and fixed a Windows compatibility bug regarding weight downloads.
2.  **Uncertainty Module:** Implemented a **Logistic Regression** model that uses the number of geometric inliers (from SuperPoint+LightGlue) to predict the probability of a correct match.
3.  **New Metrics:** Implemented the required advanced metrics: **AUSC** (Area Under Sparsification Curve) and **Spearman’s Rank Correlation**.
4.  **Comparison:** Generated comparative plots showing the robustness of our uncertainty estimation across different backbones.

## 2. Key Results for the Report
**💡 Note:** The data and plot below are ready to be inserted directly into **Section 6.2** of the final report.

### 2.1 Quantitative Comparison
We compared the uncertainty estimation performance on two different VPR methods using the same geometric verifier (SuperPoint + LightGlue):

| VPR Method | Matcher | AUPRC (Higher is better) | Spearman (Higher is better) | AUSC (Lower is better) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CosPlace** (ResNet18) | SP + LightGlue | **0.8659** | 0.5231 | **0.1643** |
| **NetVLAD** (VGG16) | SP + LightGlue | 0.8216 | **0.6123** | 0.2535 |

**Conclusions:**
* **High Reliability:** Both methods achieve high AUPRC scores (>0.82), confirming that the "Number of Inliers" is a robust proxy for prediction correctness.
* **Generalizability:** Even with NetVLAD (which has a lower base retrieval recall of ~50%), the uncertainty module effectively identifies potential errors.

### 2.2 Sparsification Curve
The generated plot shows how the error rate decreases as we reject uncertain queries.

## 🔍 Uncertainty Estimation (Section 6.2)

This module implements a probabilistic uncertainty estimation mechanism for Visual Place Recognition. Instead of relying solely on the similarity score from the VPR model (e.g., CosPlace), we use **Geometric Verification** as a proxy for confidence.

### 🛠 Methodology

We treat the uncertainty estimation as a binary classification problem solvable via **Logistic Regression**:
1.  **Retrieval:** The VPR model retrieves the top candidate.
2.  **Matching:** We apply **SuperPoint + LightGlue** to match the query with the retrieved image.
3.  **Feature:** The number of geometrically verified inliers is used as the input feature ($x$).
4.  **Prediction:** A Logistic Regression model predicts the probability of correctness ($P(y=1|x)$).

### 🧪 Experiment Design: Cross-Domain Robustness

To ensure the robustness of our uncertainty estimator, we designed a challenging **Cross-Domain** experiment:

* **Training Set (The "Teacher"):** **SVOX (Sun vs. Night)**
    * We trained the model on a difficult split where queries are taken during the day and matched against a database at night.
    * *Reasoning:* This forces the model to learn a conservative decision boundary, as even correct matches in extreme lighting changes yield fewer inliers.
* **Testing Set (The "Student"):** **SF-XS (San Francisco)**
    * The trained model was directly evaluated on the SF-XS dataset without fine-tuning.
    * *Goal:* To validate the generalization capability of the estimator across different cities and environments.

## 🚀 Execution Flow: Uncertainty Estimation (Section 6.2)

This section details the step-by-step pipeline to reproduce the Uncertainty Estimation results. The process involves generating raw VPR predictions, extracting geometric inliers via LightGlue, and training a Logistic Regression model for cross-domain evaluation.

### 1. Generate Raw Predictions & Uncertainty Data
First, run the VPR model (e.g., CosPlace) on both the **Training Set (SVOX Sun/Night)** and the **Test Set (SF-XS)**. The flag `--save_for_uncertainty` is crucial as it saves the ground truth labels and prediction indices.

```bash
# A. Generate Training Data (SVOX: Sun query vs Night database)
python ./VPR-methods-evaluation/main.py \
    --method cosplace \
    --database_folder <path_to_svox_night> \
    --queries_folder <path_to_svox_sun> \
    --save_for_uncertainty --num_preds_to_save 2000 \
    --log_dir ./logs/svox_train

# B. Generate Test Data (SF-XS)
python ./VPR-methods-evaluation/main.py \
    --method cosplace \
    --database_folder <path_to_sf_xs_db> \
    --queries_folder <path_to_sf_xs_query> \
    --save_for_uncertainty --num_preds_to_save 2000 \
    --log_dir ./logs/sfxs_test
```

### 2. Extract Geometric Features (Inliers)
Run the matching script to calculate the number of inliers for the retrieved candidates using SuperPoint + LightGlue. This converts raw images into quantitative "confidence scores" (inlier counts).

```bash
# Process SVOX Logs
python match_queries_preds.py \
    --preds-dir ./logs/svox_train/<timestamp>/preds \
    --matcher superpoint-lg --num-preds 10

# Process SF-XS Logs
python match_queries_preds.py \
    --preds-dir ./logs/sfxs_test/<timestamp>/preds \
    --matcher superpoint-lg --num-preds 10
```

### 3.Logistic Regression Model

This module implements the **Post-hoc Uncertainty Estimation** for Visual Place Recognition (VPR). It addresses the deterministic nature of VPR methods by learning a probabilistic mapping from **Geometric Inliers** to the **Probability of Correct Localization**.

To ensure robustness, the model is trained in a **Cross-Domain** setting:
* **Training (Teacher):** SVOX Night (Challenging illumination).
* **Testing (Student):** SF-XS (Urban scenes) across multiple VPR backbones.

### 📋 Features

* **Logistic Regression Model:** Maps geometric consistency (inlier counts) to confidence scores.
* **Cross-Domain Evaluation:** Validates generalization from difficult to easy domains.
* **Multi-Method Support:** Batch testing for **CosPlace, NetVLAD, MixVPR, and MegaLoc**.
* **Comprehensive Metrics:**
    * **AUPRC:** Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (Robustness).
    * **AUSE:** Area Under Sparsification Error (Calibration).
    * **Spearman's $\rho$:** Rank Correlation.
    * **$R^2$ Score:** Goodness of Fit.
* **Automated Visualization:** Generates S-Curves, Sparsification Curves, and Comparison Bar Charts.

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

The script requires the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib scikit-learn scipy
```

### 🚀 Usage Guide
#### 1. Configuration

Open universal_lr.py and modify the Configuration Area at the top to match your local file paths.

* **TRAIN_LOG_DIR:** Path to the SVOX (Night) log folder.

* **TEST_LOG_DIRS:** Dictionary of paths to SF-XS log folders for different methods.

* **MATCHER_FOLDER:** The subfolder name containing matcher results (e.g., preds_superpoint-lg).

```bash
Python
# Example Configuration
TRAIN_LOG_DIR = r"D:\AML\Projects\logs\2025-12-23_21-01-31" # Teacher
TEST_LOG_DIRS = {
    "CosPlace": r"D:\AML\Projects\logs\2025-12-30_18-45-46",
    "MegaLoc":  r"D:\AML\Projects\logs\2025-12-31_10-47-59"
}
```


#### 2. Execution

Run the script directly from the terminal:

```
Bash
python universal_lr.py
```

#### 3. Output Interpretation

The script outputs a metrics table and saves three figures.

Metrics Table

Method     | AUPRC (↑)  | AUSE (↓)   | Spearman (↑) | R2 Score (↑)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CosPlace   | 0.8611     | 0.0954     | 0.5820       | 0.0242
MegaLoc    | 0.9742     | 0.0231     | 0.4652       | -1.4816

  values (e.g., for MegaLoc) are expected in this cross-domain setup. The model, trained on the hard SVOX dataset, learns to be "conservative" (predicting lower probabilities). When applied to the highly accurate MegaLoc method on SF-XS, the model is under-confident compared to the ground truth, leading to a negative goodness-of-fit. However, the high AUPRC and positive Spearman scores confirm that the relative ranking is correct and the estimator is effective.

#### Generated Figures

* **The script automatically saves the following plots to the current directory:**

* **Fig1_Logistic_Curve.png (The S-Curve):** Visualizes the learned decision boundary. It shows how the number of inliers translates to the probability of a match being correct.

* **Fig2_Sparsification_Curve.png (Calibration):** Visualizes the AUSE. It plots the error rate as uncertain samples are removed. A smaller gap between the Model Curve and the Oracle Curve indicates better uncertainty estimation.

* **Fig3_Bar_Chart.png (Comparison):** A side-by-side comparison of all tested methods, highlighting MegaLoc as the most robust (Highest AUPRC) and reliable (Lowest AUSE) method.
